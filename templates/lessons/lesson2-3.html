            If you have been studying computer science for even a short amount of time, you probably know that strings
            of characters are a fundamental datatype in every programming language. When we discussed finite automata,
            we described them as taking in strings of characters and producing an output that is either ‘ACCEPT’ or
            ‘REJECT.’ Any string that is accepted by a given machine is in the language of the machine. In this lesson,
            we will be learning about how strings and languages are defined formally.

        <h3 style='color:var(--main-green); padding-top:18px'>Alphabets (Formally)</h3>
        <p>
            Strings may seem to be really simple objects, but the formal definition used in mathematics and theoretical
            computer science may be less intuitive than the typical way we think about them when programming. Formally,
            strings are defined in terms of their alphabet. We have already seen examples of alphabets, such as <span
                class="math-color">\( \{ 0, 1 \} \)</span> or <span class="math-color">\( \{ a, b \} \)</span>. An
            <span class="term">alphabet</span> is any nonempty finite set, and its members are called symbols of the alphabet. In the alphabets we
            previously have seen, each symbol was only one character. But, symbols of an alphabet can technically be
            many characters long. For instance, the very first automaton we saw was the automaton for a light switch.
            Its alphabet was simply one symbol: <span class="math-color">\( \{ \text{PRESS} \} \)</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We often abbreviate long alphabets using ellipses (<span class="math-color">\( \dots \)</span>):
            <span class="math-color">$$ \Sigma_1 = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} = \{ 0, 1, \dots , 9 \}$$</span>
            <span class="math-color">$$ \Sigma_2 = \{ \text{a}, \text{b}, \text{c}, \text{d}, \text{e}, \text{f},
                \text{g}, \text{h}, \text{i}, \text{j}, \text{k}, \text{l}, \text{m}, \text{n}, \text{o}, \text{p},
                \text{q}, \text{r}, \text{s}, \text{t}, \text{u}, \text{v}, \text{w}, \text{x}, \text{y}, \text{z} \} =
                \{ \text{a}, \text{b}, \dots , \text{z} \}$$</span>
        </p>
        <h3 style='color:var(--main-green); padding-top:18px'>Strings (Formally)</h3>
        <p>
            A <span class="term">string</span> over an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from that alphabet, usually written next to one
            another and not separated by commas. For example, some strings over <span class="math-color">\( \Sigma_1
                \)</span> are <span class="math-color">\( 30154\)</span>, <span class="math-color">\( 0093588 \)</span>,
            and <span class="math-color">\( 7737784412 \)</span>. <span class="math-color">\( \Sigma_2 \)</span> is the
            alphabet used by all English strings.
        </p>
        <p>
            If w is a string over <span class="math-color">\( \Sigma_1 \)</span>, the length of <span class="
                math-color">\( w \)</span>, written <span class="math-color">\( w\)</span>, is the number of symbols
            that it contains. The string <span class="
                math-color">\( w = \text{abracadabra}\)</span> over the alphabet <span class="math-color">\( \Sigma_2
                \)</span> has length <span class=" math-color">\( |w| = 11\)</span>. We introduced <span
                class="math-color">\( \varepsilon \)</span>, the empty string, briefly in other lessons. But now we have
            a better definition for it: it is the string of length <span class="math-color">\( 0 \)</span> over any
            alphabet. If <span class="math-color">\( w \)</span> over the alphabet <span class="math-color">\( \Sigma
                \)</span> has length <span class="math-color">\( n \)</span>, we can write <span class="math-color">$$ w
                = w_1w_2 \dots w_n $$</span> where each <span class="math-color">\( w_i \in \Sigma \)</span>. Don't let
            the notation fool you, though. If <span class="math-color">\( n \)</span> is one or zero, then the string
            only has one symbol or zero symbols!
        </p>
        <p>
            If we have string a <span class="math-color">\( x = x_1 x_2 \dots x_n \)</span> of length <span
                class="math-color">\( n \)</span> and string <span class="math-color">\( y = y_1 y_2 \dots x_m \)</span>
            of length <span class="math-color">\( n \)</span>, the concatenation of <span class="math-color">\( x
                \)</span> and <span class="math-color">\( y \)</span>, written <span class="math-color">\( xy \)</span>,
            is the string obtained by appending <span class="math-color">\( y
                \)</span> to the end of <span class="math-color">\( x \)</span>, as in <span class="math-color">\( x_1
                x_2 \dots x_n y_1 y_2 \dots y_m\)</span>.
        </p>
        <h3 style='color:var(--main-green); padding-top:18px'>Languages (Formally)</h3>
        <p>
            Formally, a language is a set of strings. If we say that <span class="math-color">\( L = \{ \text{abc},
                \text{cab} \} \)</span> is a language, then it is the language containing the strings <span
                class="math-color">\( \text{abc} \)</span> and <span class="math-color">\( \text{cab} \)</span>.
            Defining sets using <span class='term'>set-builder</span>

            form will come in handing when defining languages.

            form. In set-builder form, a set is described by a property that each of its members must satisfy.
            for instance, writing
            <span class="math-color">$$ S_1 = \{x : x \text{ is a positive number less than 6} \}$$</span>
            has the same meaning as
            <span class="math-color">$$ S_1 = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$</span>
            and reads as "<span class="math-color">\( S_1 \)</span> is the set of all elements
            <span class="math-color">\( x \)</span> such that <span class="math-color">\( x \)</span> is a
            positive number less than 6." When using set-builder notation, we can also define members
            of a set in terms of another set:
            <span class="math-color">$$ S_2 = \{x \in S_1 : x > 3\}$$</span>
